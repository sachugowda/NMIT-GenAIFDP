## What is Centralized Training?

**Centralized Training** is a traditional machine learning approach where all data is collected and stored in a central location (like a single server or data center). The model is trained on this entire dataset simultaneously, enabling it to learn patterns from all available data in one place.

### Key Characteristics of Centralized Training:

- **Single Data Location**: All training data is gathered and stored in one location.
- **Efficient Training**: The model has access to the entire dataset, making training straightforward.
- **High Computational Resources**: Typically requires a single powerful machine or server to handle the data and computation.
- **No Privacy Constraints**: All data is directly accessible, so it’s suitable when privacy isn’t a concern.

In contrast, **Federated Learning** (which we won’t cover here) distributes training data across multiple devices or locations, so no data leaves its source.

In this tutorial, we’ll implement centralized training using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Understanding the MNIST Dataset

The **MNIST dataset** is a classic dataset used for image classification. It contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with each image being 28x28 pixels.

- **Training Set**: 60,000 images
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images
- **Labels**: 10 classes (0 to 9)

Here’s how the data is structured:

1. Each image is represented as a 28x28 pixel grid, with each pixel value ranging from 0 to 255.
2. Each pixel value represents the brightness, with 0 as black and 255 as white.

## Building a Simple Neural Network Model

For this classification task, we’ll use a simple **fully connected neural network** (also known as a feedforward neural network). The network will consist of:

1. **Input Layer**: Takes in the 784-dimensional flattened image.
2. **Hidden Layers**: Fully connected layers with ReLU activations.
3. **Output Layer**: Outputs probabilities for each of the 10 classes (0–9).

### Steps to Build the Model

1. **Flatten the Input**: The input images are 28x28 pixels, which we’ll flatten into a 784-dimensional vector.
2. **Add Hidden Layers**: Two dense layers with ReLU activation for learning complex patterns.
3. **Output Layer**: A dense layer with softmax activation to output probabilities for each class.

## Training and Evaluating the Model

After building the model, we’ll compile it, specifying the **optimizer**, **loss function**, and **evaluation metrics**. Then we’ll train the model on the centralized dataset and evaluate its performance.

### Model Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified images out of the total images.
- **Loss**: Measures how well the model is performing. Lower loss means better performance.

## Complete Code

Here’s the full code to build, train, and evaluate a simple neural network model for digit classification on the MNIST dataset using centralized training.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Load and Preprocess the MNIST Dataset

# Load MNIST data from TensorFlow datasets
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1 by dividing by 255.0
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Step 2: Build the Neural Network Model

# Initialize a Sequential model
model = models.Sequential([
    # Flatten the input (28x28) to a 784-dimensional vector
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    # First hidden layer with 128 units and ReLU activation
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    # Second hidden layer with 64 units and ReLU activation
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    # Output layer with 10 units (one for each class) and softmax activation
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Step 3: Compile the Model

# Compile the model with Adam optimizer, Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss, and Accuracy as the metric
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Step 4: Train the Model

# Train the model on the training data, validate on the test data
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

# Step 5: Evaluate the Model on Test Data

# Evaluate the model on the test set to check its performance
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=2)
print(f"\nTest accuracy: {test_accuracy:.4f}")

# Step 6: Plot Training and Validation Accuracy

# Plotting training and validation accuracy over epochs
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy')
plt.show()
```

## Explanation of the Code

1. **Loading and Preprocessing the Data**:
   - We load the MNIST data using `tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`.
   - We normalize pixel values by dividing by 255.0 to make training more efficient and stable.

2. **Building the Model**:
   - We use `tf.keras.models.Sequential()` to build the model layer by layer.
   - **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 28x28 images into a 784-dimensional vector.
   - **Hidden Layers**: We add two dense layers with ReLU activation to learn patterns in the data.
   - **Output Layer**: A dense layer with softmax activation outputs probabilities for each of the 10 classes.

3. **Compiling the Model**:
   - **Optimizer**: We use the Adam optimizer, which is a popular choice for training neural networks.
   - **Loss Function**: `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` is used since our labels are integers (0–9) and we have multiple classes.
   - **Metric**: We track accuracy to evaluate how well the model is performing.

4. **Training the Model**:
   - We train the model on the training dataset (`x_train`, `y_train`) for 10 epochs.
   - We use the test set (`x_test`, `y_test`) as validation data to monitor performance during training.

5. **Evaluating the Model**:
   - After training, we evaluate the model on the test set to get a final accuracy score.

6. **Plotting Training and Validation Accuracy**:
   - We plot the training and validation accuracy over each epoch to see if the model is improving and to check for signs of overfitting (when validation accuracy diverges from training accuracy).

- **Simple Neural Network**: We used a fully connected neural network with ReLU activations for image classification.
- **Evaluation**: We measured the model's accuracy on a test set and plotted training/validation accuracy to check performance.
